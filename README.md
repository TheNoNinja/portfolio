# Portfolio
This is my portfolio remake. My first portfolio was made with WordPress which was quite slow and bad to manage. Now I wanted to create the whole thing from scratch and make everything myself.

# Set up
To make articles, change categories, and upload images you must edit '/src/firebase/index.js' to contain your own config. Firebase is completely free for small-time applications like this.

To run the webapp run the following commands in your terminal:
```
npm install
npm run serve
```
> NOTE: You only have to run npm install once to get the npm packages needed to run this application. 

## Prerequisites
For this project to work you need the following software installed:
- Node.js
- npm (comes with Node.js)

If you want to have your own data on the webapp you will need firebase. It's completely free for small-time applications like this.
